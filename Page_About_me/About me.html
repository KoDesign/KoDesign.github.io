    I'm a twenty years old Norwegian bachelor student, born and raised in Oslo. Iâ€™ve been working a lot with graphic design the past years and are looking for jobs to expand on my knowledge and experiences.  <br><br>

I have a passion for abstract logos and logos with people in it. But I can make a wide variety of styles. Just check out my <a href="../Page_Gallery/Gallery.html" class="linka">gallery</a> if you want to see some of the things i have made earlier. I also have a wide variety of skills and not only Logo design. Check out my <a href="../Page_Skills/Skills.html" class="linka">skills</a>. And if there is a need for contact, just visit the <a class="linka" href="../Page_Contact/Contact.html">contact</a> section.
